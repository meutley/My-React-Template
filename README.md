# My React Template
This is a personal project I created when I was learning more about React. I built it with a basic node back end, and React with Babel and Webpack on the front end.

# Running the Application
1. Run "npm install", to install package dependencies
2. Run "npm install -g mocha" in order to run unit tests
3. Run "npm test" to run the unit tests
4. Run "npm run start-dev" to start the node server and the Webpack watch
5. Point your web browser to http://localhost:3000/
